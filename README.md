# Refactoring-Mockup
## Refactoring mockup so that it is more presentable and accessible

### User Story
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

### Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

My motivation for this project is to refactor the mockup so that its more accessible for other people
I built this project in order to learn more about CSS and html, as well as make it more presentable
The project sovles the issue of unncessary code, and clears up the code too
I learnt that HTML semantic elements help clear code of unncessary information.
